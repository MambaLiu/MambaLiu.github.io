    "INTRODUCE_TEXT":"I come from 'the most center of the Eurasian continent' and 'the city farthest from the ocean in the world'-Urumqi, located at the northern foot of the middle section of the Tianshan Mountains and adjacent to Central Asian countries. It is Xinjiang’s politics, culture, science, education, and transportation. center. What I like most is all the food made of our Xinjiang mutton (and the Cantonese morning tea), undergraduate major: software engineering, currently working in Shenzhen, working as a front-end development. The favorite multiplayer sport is playing ball. My favorite single player sport is coding. I also like to play dark-realistic FPS games with my friends, such as hardcore games like Escape Takov, but they can often be played as funny games. I want to be a funny game anchor and dream of being able to collaborate with others to develop some ideas in the future. Sexual product entrepreneurship."
